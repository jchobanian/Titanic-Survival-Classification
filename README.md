# Titanic-Survival-Classification-
Who survived the Titanic? Predictive models
This was my first solo data science project. I wanted to work on several predictive models to compare their performance. 

For this project I used Python 3.0 and the following libraries:
- Numpy for linear algebra
- Pandas for data processing

- Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn for data visualization

- Machine learning models from Sklearn:
LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, VotingClassifier 

- Evaluation models from Sklearn
Cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
